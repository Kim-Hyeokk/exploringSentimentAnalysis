### Feature
In machine learning, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon. In different contexts, it can be considered as a predictor or an independent variable. Feature variable's values are the inputs given to a machine learning algorithm. Hence, in the context of programming, a feature can be considered as an input variable.
### Label
A label is the measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon that we are predicting. In different contexts, it can be considered as a target or a dependent variable. A label's expected values for a given collection of inputs are used in supervised machine learning to train a model.
